# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an intelligent e-commerce assistant that leverages MindsDB for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), providing personalized shopping recommendations and product information. The system combines semantic document retrieval with structured predictions to deliver contextually relevant responses grounded in merchant data, while maintaining tenant isolation and explainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Intelligent Document Retrieval and Prediction System

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to receive personalized product recommendations based on semantic search and predictive analytics, so that I can discover relevant products and make informed shopping decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a merchant uploads product data THEN the system SHALL store documents with embeddings in a vector-enabled database
2. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL return the top-k most semantically similar documents with relevance scores
3. WHEN a product SKU is identified in the context THEN the system SHALL generate demand_score and purchase_probability predictions
4. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL include user context and historical behavior data with explainability metadata
5. WHEN multiple products are considered THEN the system SHALL rank them by combined relevance and prediction scores
6. WHEN documents are updated THEN the system SHALL recompute embeddings and update the vector index

### Requirement 2: Agent Orchestration and Response Generation

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to interact with an intelligent assistant that provides accurate, grounded responses and can autonomously coordinate complex shopping tasks, so that I receive trustworthy information and seamless service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user query is received THEN the system SHALL use Bedrock AgentCore to parse intent and generate a reasoning plan
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL ground all factual claims in the retrieved documents
3. WHEN sub-tasks are identified THEN AgentCore SHALL invoke the appropriate tools (Amazon Q, MindsDB, Checkout API)
4. WHEN recommending products THEN the system SHALL reference specific document sources and limit recommendations to 3 items
5. WHEN documents don't contain sufficient information THEN the system SHALL explicitly state information limitations
6. WHEN orchestrating multiple steps THEN the agent SHALL maintain conversational state across sub-tasks
7. IF a tool invocation fails THEN AgentCore SHALL handle retries or gracefully fallback to escalation

### Requirement 3: Secure Transaction Processing

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to securely complete purchases directly through the assistant, so that I can transition seamlessly from recommendation to transaction without leaving the chat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user expresses purchase intent THEN the system SHALL confirm the product, quantity, and price before proceeding
2. WHEN executing a checkout THEN the system SHALL invoke a secure Checkout API with authenticated session tokens
3. WHEN a transaction completes THEN the system SHALL record the order in the merchant's database with a unique transaction ID
4. IF any transaction step fails THEN the system SHALL rollback the operation and notify the user of the failure reason
5. WHEN processing transactions THEN the system SHALL redact sensitive data from conversational logs

### Requirement 4: Multi-Tenant Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to ensure complete data isolation between merchants and protect customer privacy, so that sensitive business information remains secure and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL filter all data access by merchant_id
2. WHEN creating predictors THEN the system SHALL ensure tenant-specific model training and inference
3. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL partition data by tenant for performance and isolation
4. WHEN processing user queries THEN the system SHALL redact or tokenize PII before sending to external LLM services
5. WHEN accessing MindsDB THEN the system SHALL authenticate using secure API keys stored in AWS Secrets Manager
6. IF cross-tenant data access is attempted THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate error logging
7. WHEN auditing is required THEN the system SHALL provide complete traceability of data access and model decisions

### Requirement 5: Performance, Scalability, and Cost Efficiency

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to deliver fast response times while maintaining cost efficiency at scale, so that users have a great experience and the business remains profitable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a query THEN the system SHALL complete retrieval and prediction within 300ms
2. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL maintain response times through caching strategies
3. WHEN the document corpus grows THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-linear search performance through proper indexing
4. WHEN processing user sessions THEN the average total compute cost SHALL remain below $0.05 per session
5. WHEN workloads increase THEN the system SHALL apply auto-scaling policies to optimize resource use without exceeding target SLAs
6. WHEN embeddings are computed THEN the system SHALL batch process updates to optimize cost and performance
7. WHEN cost anomalies occur THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts for investigation

### Requirement 6: Monitoring, Observability, and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring of the RAG system performance and quality metrics, so that I can maintain service quality and identify issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL measure and log grounding accuracy against retrieved documents
2. WHEN retrievals occur THEN the system SHALL track recall@k metrics for semantic search quality
3. WHEN predictions are made THEN the system SHALL monitor model drift and prediction confidence distributions
4. WHEN invoking MindsDB predictors or Bedrock LLMs THEN the system SHALL log token and compute utilization to CloudWatch
5. IF system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and automated remediation where possible
6. WHEN evaluating system health THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing end-to-end latency, accuracy, and usage metrics
7. WHEN producing reports THEN the system SHALL summarize per-merchant resource consumption for billing transparency
