**[00:00-00:15] Introduction**
> "Welcome to the RAG Assistant Merchant Platform! I'm going to show you how our AI-powered shopping assistant can transform your e-commerce site and boost conversions. Let's dive in."

**[00:15-00:45] What is RAG Assistant?**
> "RAG Assistant is an embeddable chat widget that uses advanced AI to help your customers find exactly what they're looking for. Instead of browsing through hundreds of products, customers can simply ask questions in natural language, like 'Show me wireless headphones under $200' or 'What's the best laptop for video editing?'"

> "Here are the key features you'll get:
> - **Smart Product Recommendations**: AI-powered search that understands intent
> - **Natural Conversations**: Customers chat naturally, no complex filters
> - **Seamless Integration**: Works with Shopify, WooCommerce, or any custom platform
> - **Real-time Analytics**: Track what customers are asking and optimize accordingly
> - **Easy Setup**: Get started in under 10 minutes"

**[01:15-01:45] How It Works**
> "The platform has three main components:
> 1. **Developer Portal**: Where you manage your account, API keys, and view analytics
> 2. **Chat Widget**: The embeddable component that goes on your website
> 3. **API**: For programmatic access to all features
>
> You upload your product catalog, customize the widget to match your brand, and embed it on your site. That's it!"

**[01:45-02:15] Demo**
> "Let me show you a quick demo. Here's an e-commerce site with our widget installed. Watch what happens when I ask for 'noise-cancelling headphones for travel'..."

> - 35% increase in conversion rates
> - 50% reduction in support tickets
> - 2x higher average order value
> - Better customer satisfaction scores"

**[02:45-03:00] Next Steps**

>
> Keep your API keys secure:
> - Never commit them to version control
> - Don't share them publicly
> - Use environment variables in your code
> - Rotate keys regularly
> - Revoke keys if compromised"

#### Script

**[00:00-00:15] Introduction**
> "Ready to add the RAG Assistant widget to your website? I'll show you how to do it in under 5 minutes. Let's go!"

**[00:15-00:45] Getting the Embed Code**
> "Log into your Developer Portal and navigate to 'Widget' in the sidebar. Click 'Get Embed Code'. You'll see a code snippet that looks like this..."
>
> [Screen recording: Show Developer Portal widget section]

**[00:45-01:30] Understanding the Code**
> "This is a standard JavaScript embed snippet. It does three things:
> 1. Loads the widget script asynchronously
> 2. Initializes the widget with your credentials
> 3. Configures basic settings
>
> You'll need to replace two placeholders:
> - YOUR_MERCHANT_ID: Your unique merchant identifier
> - YOUR_API_KEY: The API key you created earlier"
>
> [Screen recording: Highlight the placeholders in the code]

**[01:30-02:30] Installation Methods**
> "There are three ways to install the widget:
>
> **Method 1: Direct HTML** (Easiest)
> Copy the code and paste it before the closing </body> tag in your HTML.
>
> **Method 2: Google Tag Manager**
> Create a new Custom HTML tag and paste the code there.
>
> **Method 3: Platform-Specific**
> For Shopify, WooCommerce, or other platforms, we have specific guides.
>
> I'll show you Method 1 first."
>
> [Screen recording: Show code editor with HTML file]

**[02:30-03:15] Installing on Your Website**
> "Open your website's HTML file or template. Find the closing </body> tag. Paste the embed code right before it. Save the file.
>
> If you're using a CMS like WordPress, you can add it to your theme's footer.php file or use a plugin like 'Insert Headers and Footers'."
>
> [Screen recording: Show code being pasted into HTML file]

**[03:15-04:00] Testing the Installation**
> "Now let's test it! Open your website in a browser. You should see a chat icon in the bottom-right corner. Click it to open the widget.
>
> Try asking a question like 'Show me your products'. If you haven't uploaded products yet, you'll see a message saying no products are available. That's normal!"
>
> [Screen recording: Show widget appearing on website and being tested]

**[04:00-04:30] Troubleshooting**
> "Widget not appearing? Check these common issues:
> 1. Make sure you replaced the placeholders with your actual credentials
> 2. Check the browser console for errors (press F12)
> 3. Verify your domain is whitelisted in Settings
> 4. Clear your browser cache and reload
>
> Still having issues? Check our troubleshooting guide or contact support."

**[04:30-05:00] Next Steps**

    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>
```

#### Script

**[00:00-00:15] Introduction**
> "Now that your widget is installed, let's upload your products so the AI can start making intelligent recommendations. I'll show you three different methods."

**[00:15-01:00] Understanding Product Data**
> "The AI needs specific information about each product:
> - **Title**: Product name
> - **Description**: Detailed description with features and benefits
> - **SKU**: Unique product identifier
> - **Price**: Current price
> - **Category**: Product category
> - **Image URL**: Link to product image
> - **Stock Status**: Whether it's in stock
> - **Product URL**: Link to product page
>
> The more detailed your descriptions, the better the AI recommendations!"

**[01:00-02:30] Method 1: CSV Upload (Easiest)**
> "The easiest way is CSV upload. Go to 'Product Sync' in the Developer Portal and click 'Upload CSV'.
>
> First, download our CSV template. It has all the required columns. Open it in Excel or Google Sheets.
>
> Fill in your product data. Here's an example:
> - Title: 'Wireless Bluetooth Headphones'
> - Description: 'Premium noise-cancelling headphones with 30-hour battery life...'
> - SKU: 'WBH-001'
> - Price: 199.99
> - Category: 'Electronics'
>
> Save the file and upload it. The system will validate and import your products."
>
> [Screen recording: Show CSV template, filling it out, and uploading]

**[02:30-04:00] Method 2: API Upload (For Developers)**
> "If you're a developer, you can use our API to upload products programmatically. This is great for automation.
>
> Here's a simple example using cURL:
>
> ```bash
> curl -X POST https://api.rag-assistant.com/api/documents/bulk \
>   -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
>   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
>   -d '{
>     \"documents\": [
>       {
>         \"type\": \"product\",
>         \"title\": \"Wireless Headphones\",
>         \"content\": \"Premium noise-cancelling...\",
>         \"metadata\": {
>           \"sku\": \"WBH-001\",
>           \"price\": 199.99,
>           \"inStock\": true
>         }
>       }
>     ]
>   }'
> ```
>
> You can also use our SDKs for JavaScript, Python, PHP, or Ruby."
>
> [Screen recording: Show API request in Postman or terminal]

**[04:00-05:30] Method 3: Platform Integration (Automated)**
> "For Shopify or WooCommerce users, we have automatic sync options.
>
> **Shopify:**
> Install our Shopify app from the App Store. It automatically syncs your products every hour.
>
> **WooCommerce:**
> Install our WordPress plugin. Configure your API key and enable auto-sync.
>
> **Custom Platforms:**
> Use webhooks to sync products in real-time whenever they're created or updated."
>
> [Screen recording: Show Shopify app installation and configuration]

**[05:30-06:15] Verifying Your Upload**
> "After uploading, go to 'Product Sync' > 'History' to see the status. Products are indexed within 2-3 minutes.
>
> Once indexed, test the widget! Ask questions like:
> - 'Show me wireless headphones'
> - 'What's under $200?'
> - 'Best products for travel'
>
> The AI should now return relevant product recommendations!"
>
> [Screen recording: Show product sync status and testing widget]

**[06:15-06:45] Best Practices**
> "For best results:
> - Write detailed, descriptive product descriptions
> - Include key features and benefits
> - Use consistent categorization
> - Keep prices and stock status updated
> - Add high-quality images
> - Update products regularly"

**[06:45-07:00] Next Steps**
> "Great! Your products are uploaded and the widget is working. Next, we'll customize the widget to match your brand. See you there!"

> ra('init', {
>   merchantId: 'your_merchant_id',
>   apiKey: 'your_api_key',
>   theme: {
>     // Visual customization

> }
> ```
>
> Let me show you how each color affects the widget..."
>

>
> "Pro tip: Use your website's CSS variables to keep colors consistent:
>
> ```javascript
> primaryColor: getComputedStyle(document.documentElement)
>   .getPropertyValue('--brand-primary')
> ```"

**[03:00-04:00] Position & Layout**
> "Control where the widget appears:
>
> ```javascript
> theme: {
>   position: 'bottom-right',  // or bottom-left, top-right, top-left
>   offset: {
>     bottom: '20px',
>     right: '20px'
>   },
>   borderRadius: '12px',
>   boxShadow: '0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)'
> }
> ```
>
> Watch how the position changes..."
>
> [Screen recording: Show widget in different positions]

**[04:00-05:00] Behavior Customization**
> "Now let's customize how the widget behaves:
>
> ```javascript
> behavior: {
>   autoOpen: false,              // Auto-open on page load
>   autoOpenDelay: 3000,          // Delay in milliseconds
>   greeting: 'Hi! How can I help?',
>   placeholder: 'Ask me anything...',
>   maxRecommendations: 3,        // Products per response
>   showTypingIndicator: true,
>   persistHistory: true          // Remember conversations
> }
> ```"
>
> [Screen recording: Demonstrate each behavior option]

**[05:00-06:00] Mobile Optimization**
> "The widget automatically adapts to mobile, but you can customize mobile behavior:
>
> ```javascript
> behavior: {
>   mobile: {
>     fullScreen: true,           // Full screen on mobile
>     position: 'bottom',
>     showCloseButton: true,
>     swipeToClose: true
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> Let me show you how it looks on mobile..."
>
> [Screen recording: Show mobile view using browser dev tools]

**[06:00-07:00] Advanced Styling**
> "For advanced customization, use custom CSS:
>
> ```javascript
> theme: {
>   customCSS: `
>     .rag-widget-header {
>       background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
>     }
>     .rag-widget-message {
>       border-radius: 20px;
>     }
>   `
> }
> ```
>
> You can target any widget element with CSS selectors."
>
> [Screen recording: Show custom CSS being applied]

**[07:00-07:40] Testing Your Customization**
> "Always test your customization:
> 1. Check on desktop and mobile
> 2. Test in different browsers
> 3. Verify colors have good contrast (accessibility)
> 4. Make sure text is readable
> 5. Test with your actual product data"
